# Hash-Table-Implementation
Ibrahim Hosh.
Implemented 3 Hash function to two common situations (general - unknown data, and
specific - known data) with the goal of minimizing the number of key collisions and increase speed. 
The program will scan and run a txt file then display average number of collisions, longest chain of tokens, unique tokens, non-empty indexes, and empty indexes. 
To run a specific file txt file, change variable args[0] in main to file path as a string.
